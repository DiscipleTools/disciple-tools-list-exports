# Disciple Tools - List Exports

Bulk export your contact list to blind batch emails (BCC), CSV, a phone list, or a map.

This plugin adds a tile which allows you to export the contact list to blind carbon copy (BCC) email list, a phone list, a CSV, or a high quality map. 
The purpose of this project is to create additional exports on the list/filter pages (Contacts) which would allow you to
build a list click a button that would trigger a BCC email in your email client, map all listed contacts on a mapbox map,
export the list of emails and phone numbers to csv, and display a block of phone numbers that you can copy and paste into
your message app (iMessage, WhatsApp, Signal)

---

This tile is added to the left side of the Contacts list menu. Once you have created your list by using default or custom filters, you can select the type of export.
